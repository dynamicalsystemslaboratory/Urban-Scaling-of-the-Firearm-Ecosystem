# Urban-Scaling-of-the-Firearm-Ecosystem

# This GitHub repository has the necessary codes and instructions to replicate the results of the paper
The folders and files are:

1-"Clean_data": Has the data about the SAMIs of the three main variables, as well as the SAMIs of the 5 variables. The folder also contains processed data on firearm armed robberies and gun shops and the aggregated population of the years 2013-2018. The raw data can be found as described in the manuscript.

2-"Helpers": This folder has two datasets that we used to aggregate data from zip code resolution to county resolution and from county resolution to MSA/MicroSA resolution

3-"Supplement_Causal" This folder has the copy of the results and script of the PC algorithm of the Python package gcastle, modified to perform mutual information as the statistical test of independence.

4-"Armed_Robberies_Scaling": This script provides an example of how we did the scaling analysis and get the SAMIs

5-"Causal Results": This is the script of the main causal analysis with the three main variables.
